# School Project - Job Application Form

This project is part of my school coursework. It's a web application for job applications, and it's still a work in progress.

## Progress So Far

So far, I've completed the following steps:

1. **HTML Pages**: I've created the basic structure of the web pages using HTML. This includes the job application form and other related pages.

2. **CSS Styling**: I've added some basic styles to the pages using CSS. This includes layout, colors, fonts, etc.

3. **Form Validation**: I've implemented form validation using JavaScript. This ensures that all required fields are filled in before the form can be submitted.

## Future Work

I plan to continue developing this project by adding more features and improving the existing ones. This includes enhancing the user interface, adding more interactivity, connecting to a database, etc.

## Feedback

I welcome any feedback or suggestions. Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you for checking out my project!
