# School Project - JavaScrip Form Validation

This project is part of my school coursework.

## Progress 

So far, I've completed the following steps:

1. **HTML Pages**: I've created the basic structure of the web pages using HTML. This includes the job application form and other related pages.

2. **CSS Styling**: I've added some basic styles to the pages using CSS. This includes layout, colors, fonts, etc.

3. **Form Validation**: I've implemented form validation using JavaScript. This ensures that all required fields are filled in before the form can be submitted.
